Contents: submitted assignments for the Penn State course GEOG 485, GIS Programming and Software Development.

Purpose: I have created this repository to share general geoprocessing scripts I have written in Python. Currently, everything in this repository was written for assignments in the Penn State course GEOG485.

Disclaimer: I am brand new to Github! I hope to quickly learn some best practices for documenting and sharing code on this platform. It definitely strikes me as improper to upload a handful of scripts online without any context, so I will be sure to update this repository continuously as I figure these things out. My priority right now, of course, is just to keep exploring the geoprocessing capabilities of Python scripting.
