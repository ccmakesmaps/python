Contents: submitted assignments for the Penn State course GEOG 485, GIS Programming and Software Development.

Purpose: I have created this repository to share geoprocessing scripts I have written in Python, with the aim of attaining a professional position in which I can apply these skills.

Disclaimer: I am brand new to Github! I hope to quickly learn some best practices for documenting and sharing code on this platform. It definitely strikes me as improper to upload a handful of scripts online without any context, so I will be sure to update this repository continuously as I figure these things out.
